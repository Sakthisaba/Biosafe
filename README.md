# BioSafe
BioSafe is a Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) model that is used for Biometric Authentication.It ensure that the biometric data does not get stored with a central entity. It enables web developers to integrate biometric authentication since the decentralisation is applied on the biometrics. It empowers the end users to store the biometric in one entity and use it for authentication anywhere. The block chain provides decentralisation and security for data. Thus the biometric data uploaded by the user remains untampered and unmodified.
